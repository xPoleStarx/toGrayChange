#Images in Python 📷
This code shows how to use NumPy and Matplotlib libraries in Python to load, display, and transform an image. 🐍

##What the Code Does
It imports the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. 📚
It reads an image from a file using plt.imread() function. 🖼️
It shows the original image using plt.imshow() function and plt.title() function. 🖥️
It changes the image to grayscale using np.dot() function and a weighted average of the RGB channels. 🌑
It applies a threshold to the grayscale image using np.where() function and makes a binary image. 🌓
It shows the binary image using plt.imshow() function with a gray colormap and plt.title() function. 🖥️
It displays the plots using plt.tight_layout() function and plt.show() function. 🎨
##How to Run the Code
You need Python 3.x installed on your computer.
You need NumPy and Matplotlib libraries installed on your computer.
You need an image file in PNG or JPEG format saved on your computer.
You need to change the path to the image file in the code.
You need to run the code in a Python interpreter or an IDE.
