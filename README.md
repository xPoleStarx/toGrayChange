# ðŸŒ„ Image Processing with NumPy and Matplotlib

This repository contains a Python script for loading an image using NumPy and Matplotlib, converting it to grayscale, applying a binary threshold, and displaying the original and binary images.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need the following libraries installed:

- NumPy ðŸ§®
- Matplotlib ðŸ“Š

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xPoleStarx/toGrayChange.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd image-processing
   ```

3. Place your image file in the project directory (e.g., `image.png`).

4. Open the `toGrayChange.py` file and modify the following line to specify the path to your image:

   ```python
   image = plt.imread('path/to/image/image.png')
   ```

5. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python toGrayChange.py
   ```

6. The script will display two plots: the original image and the binary image.
